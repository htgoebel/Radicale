title: Migration from 1.x.x to 2.0.x
permalink: /1to2/

## Why a Migration?

Radicale 2.0.x is different from 1.x.x, here's everything you need to know about
this! **Please read this page carefully if you want to update Radicale.**

You'll also find extra information
in [issue #372](https://github.com/Kozea/Radicale/issues/372).

### Python 3 Only

Radicale 2.0.x works with Python >= 3.3, and **doesn't work anymore with
Python 2**.

(No, Python 3.3 is not new, it's been released more than 4 years ago.
Debian stable provides Python 3.4.)

### Dependencies

Radicale now depends on [VObject](https://eventable.github.io/vobject/), a
"full-featured Python package for parsing and creating iCalendar and vCard
files". That's the price to pay to correctly read crazy iCalendar files and
**support date-based filters, even on recurring events**.

### Server conmfigurations

* The options `base_prefix` and `can_skip_base_prefix` have been removed. If you
are serving radicale from behind another web-server using a different path then
`/`, please make sure the web-server passes the correct `SCRIPT_NAME` value. For
nginx this is someling like
```
        location /radicale/ {
                proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5232;
                proxy_set_header X-Script-Name /radicale;
                … }
```
  

### Storage

Calendars and address books are stored in a different way between 1.x.x and 2.0.x
versions. **Launching 2.0.x without migrating your collections first will not
work, Radicale won't be able to read your previous data.**

There's now only one way to store data in Radicale: collections are stored as
folders and events / contacts are stored in files. This new storage is close to
the `multifilesystem`, but **it's now thread-safe, with atomic writes and file
locks**.

Migrating your data can be done with tool called
[transplant](https://github.com/Kozea/transplant/blob/master/transplant.py)
that will copy your collections from one server to another using
CalDAV / CardDAV requests. Following these simple steps will help you migrate
your data:

- Stop Radicale 1.x.x,
- edit your configuration to only listen to `http://localhost:5232`,
- remove authentication,
- restart the 1.x.x server,
- download Radicale 2.0.x and go into the downloaded folder,
- launch Radicale 2.0.x with
  `python3 radicale.py --config=/dev/null --hosts=localhost:5233 --storage-filesystem-folder=~/.local/share/radicale/`,
- download transplant and go into the downloaded folder,
- launch transplant with `python3 transplant http://localhost:5232 http://localhost:5233`,
- you're done!

This migration should work at least with simple configurations of Radicale 1.x.x
on Linux and macOS. Please adapt these steps carefully if you're on Windows or
if you're using a more complex configuration.

Other storage types can be used by creating [plugins](/plugins/). These storage
types can reuse the current storage class to extend it (for example to add
versioning) or can be totally different from it (yes, don't worry, you can
write your own storage plugin using a DataBase®™ if you want).

### Authentication

**Radicale 2.0.x only provides htpasswd authentication out-of-the-box.** Other
authentication methods can be added by creating or using [plugins](/plugins/).

### Rights

In Radicale 2.0.x, rights are managed using regex-based rules based on the
login of the authenticated user and the URL of the resource. Default
configurations are built in for common cases, you'll find more about this on
the [Authentication & Rights](/rights/) page.

Other rights managers can be added by creating [plugins](/plugins/).
